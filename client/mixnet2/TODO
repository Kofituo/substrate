zeroing of out vec? no long term key material, maybe don't bother
if newest message to go out, request timer reset

just publish addresses (inc peer id) along with public key on blockchain
fetch off blockchain incrementally; query count every block, initiate connections as they come in?

rate limiting: limit rate to each peer, disconnect if peer sending too much?
